                <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                    I grew up in Pensacola, FL where I went to Pensacola State college and got my AS Computer Science Degree. I got in to Computer Science because I enjoyed playing video games. While I had the intention of doing every computer programming class while I was in school. I also tried to get a lot of coding experience under my belt. In school I also went to Computer Science competitions just for the coding experience.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px">The first computer programming competition I was in, a team of 4 people and I decided to do a Java/Android studio application. This application was a pre kindergartener app that would help learn ABC’s and an early counting problem at an early age. I was instructed to make a splash page for the application. In this competition we ended up scoring 5th place. But I took the experience in to consideration while preparing for my next competition.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px">Next competition I attended was for an internship if I won. This was an interesting experience for me. Being that my only team member was someone I met that day. We headed out to Mobile Alabama from Pensacola, Fl where the competition took place. Are instruction being to make a computer application that would follow the Mardi Gras floats. During the competition James (partner) and I decided that we wanted to make the application using Android studio. At the competition, we learned about basic JSON. At the end the of the competition we had to present our application. Because of our idea on trying to make the application go mobile. No other group presented the application with an outside box idea. My team ended up taking first place and winning the internship.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px">During my internship with the company RSI (Rural Sourcing Inc), James and I were allowed to work on the RSI mobile application. While we working on the application, we learned about source control. Learned about fixing a broken application that was left from a previous employee. We ended up adding brand new map images, fixing their google maps API issue and releasing a new version of the application to the google play store. Was introduced to the QA process. Understanding version differences and the entire process on what was required to maintain client satisfaction.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                    I attended a software development boot camp for a company called Provalus. This class was 9 weeks long, but took my coding understanding to the next level. This class had me understand web services, database interpretation, and thread understanding. This also reform my basics and help me with presenting in front of clients.</p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                    I’m looking for a software development position so I can continue my education and understanding computer programming. I enjoy learning, and have self-taught myself Python. I enjoy programming and leaning future opportunities in the software development world.
